**Vero Volley Sentiment Analysis Project**

## Description
This project was developed in collaboration with Vero Volley, a sports company specialized in volleyball. Our team focused on sentiment analysis regarding the Vero Volley's women's team on social media platforms. The main objective was to create a tool capable of detecting and flagging offensive comments from users towards the team's athletes.

## Tools Used
We implemented the data scraping process using the code provided in the GitHub repository [social-crawlers](https://github.com/litovn/social-crawlers). This enabled us to gather a wide range of comments and public opinions from various social channels related to Vero Volley.

Subsequently, we utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate the sentiment of each comment. We were able to identify not only positive and neutral comments but also negative and offensive ones.

## Tool Features
The tool we developed offers the following features:

1. **Offensive Comment Detection**: The system is capable of automatically identifying comments containing offensive or negative language directed towards the athletes of Vero Volley's women's team.

2. **Insult Reporting**: Offensive comments are highlighted and reported to the social media administrators of Vero Volley for further action.

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: We provide an intuitive dashboard to visualize statistics and trends on comment sentiments, allowing Vero Volley to have a comprehensive overview of the public perception of their team.

## Usage
To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Scrape the data using the code provided in the GitHub repository mentioned above.
2. Install the project dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Launch the tool and upload the collected data from the scraping.
4. Review the obtained results and take any necessary actions based on the reports of offensive comments.
