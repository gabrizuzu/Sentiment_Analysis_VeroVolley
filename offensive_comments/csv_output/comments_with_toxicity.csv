@rusnick12 well yes ethnic discrimination might exist many years ago. But this is two sided in the society. There are always some groups dont like each other. If you talk about Ottoman Empire its true ð I am talking about class discrimination and colonism and these doesnt exist in here. And which African immigrants? In fact it is very rare thing to see African people in Turkey and we never have negative ideas about them. Just reach someone  and ask or read internet playforms or just come and see yourself ð And someone who tries to show Turkey as skin colour racist which doesnt exist. Just wow.

"Non averti in nazionale Ã© doloroso ma comprensibile. In queste settimane vederti in panchina Ã© stata una mortificazione al tuo talento immenso.  Ci sono momenti in cui la federazione deve tutelare le sue atlete e tu come altre siete fuori dalla nazionale non per scelta tecnica ma perchÃ© lâallenatore non aveva piÃ¹ in mano la squadra. Quindi per avere in mano la squadra sono state epurate alcune delle migliori giocatrici nel proprio ruolo e questi sono i risultati. In quale pianeta quando un allenatore non ha piÃ¹ il controllo non si manda via lâallenatore ma le atlete piÃ¹ forti? @fipav siamo sicuri che questo Ã¨ il percorso? Quanto ancora dobbiamo vedere questo scempio in panchina? Malinov, Bosetti, Chirichella, De Gennaro e Egonu giocherebbero in qualsiasi altra nazionale vincente!!!

"Mi chiedo se Milano merita un pubblico cosÃ¬  meraviglioso. Una squadra che si scioglie dopo un solo set. Un allenatore che durante i tempi non da mai, dico mai, indicazioni tecniche, ma solo stimoli motivazionali totalmente inutili. Conegliano ha vinto perchÃ© ha Santarelli che da sempre precise indicazioni tecniche, perchÃ©  ha battuto meglio, alzato e ricevuto meglio e perchÃ©  ha due martelli che fanno decine di punti.  Per la Supercoppa ho detto le stesse cose e mi sono attirato tante critiche. Insisto, per me Milano dovrebbe cambiare coach e acquistare un martello ricevitore in grado di fare punto quando la ricezione Ã¨  sporca e la palla troppo staccata a rete. A che Ã¨ servito avere la Egonu, se i risultati sono peggiori con Conegliano di quando lei non c'era. Ma il problema vero Ã¨ il coach, bravo, ma non ingrado di fare la svolta decisiva.

"@jruby08 I remember that time as well. Youâre right. She was kinda trying to relieve, obviously, there was much pressure on her. In Milano, everyone expects Paola to score and win the match. If she got 77 balls meaning that she has to jump high 77 times against high, well formed block and score. This is really tiring, at one point it is normal that you cant control. At that time there is no need to push the player, but Orro was keep setting to her. Gaspari didnt take her out of the court for a second to have a chat with her. Paola did what she could have done.

Orro un campionato non bello, pochi cambi di gioco, 80/90 palloni a partita a Egonu, pochissimi primi tempi e  le pipe si contano sulle dita di una mano, ma chi le dice di fare un certo gioco? L'allenatore, il maggior colpevole di tutto questo, poco utilizzo della panchina, avevamo Stysiak, Thompson e Davyskyba e sono arrivate, Bajema, Cazaute e Daalderop, le prime 3 assolutamente piÃ¹ forti di quest'ultime e non dimentichiamoci che l'anno scorso siamo arrivati a giocare la finale scudetto con una certa Larson.

@muccy parlo da appassionato di pallavolo. Secondo me il problema Ã¨ chi gestisce la squadra. Non dico l'allenatore... ma a livello dirigenziale. Una montagna si soldi spesi per avere grandi nomi e visibilitÃ . Ma senza creare uno spogliatoio compatto che lotta per un obbiettivo comune. E l'arrivo di pietrini non servirÃ  a niente. Ci sono giocatrici strapagate perciÃ² senza stimoli o ambizioni di vittoria. E sarÃ  cosÃ¬ anche in nazionale... Anche se dovessero vincere la champions sarÃ  comunque una stagione fallimentare.,0.07687678,0.004081726,0.00725158,0.043250903,0.131460989

"Based on the FIVB (2021-2024) rule, the following MUST be true for this play to be legal. 1: the ball must cross the net plane entirely OUTSIDE of the antenna (10.1.2). 2: the player MUST NOT touch the opponent's court (10.1.2.1). 3: when playing the ball back, the ball must again travel entirely OUTSIDE of the antenna (10.1.2.2).

Everyone know how Daalderop and Bajema don't know pass in the pression. Last season who did everything was Gabi in Vakifbank. Sylla is great attack but she doesn't know passing and will be worse next season because of Pietrini. MB's in Milano don't know serving. Everyone saw what Diop did today on serving 7 in the row. Orro is a great setter but she can't improved more her game. Brenda will away next season and everything will be a challenge. Egonu doesn't did a great game but when OH's don't passing and attacking I really think Egonu doesn't will save anything.

Da salvare solo il reparto centrali in questi ultimi due mesi, specie Rapha Folie  ma anche Retkee quando chiamata.

"@edoardostefanii_ Certo,arrivare secondi e giocarsi 2 gare su 3 in casa in semifinale non conta nulla.
Non aver fatto nessun miglioramento rispetto a tutti gli altri campionati,sia a livello di posizionamento e di punti,non conta nulla.
Arrivare secondi e avere un miglior piazzamento in ranking per andare in Champions l'anno prossimo, se non si raggiunge la finale scudetto,  non conta nulla.
Quindi neanche aver battuto il Fenerbache l'altra sera,conta nulla, giusto?",0.019854378,0.0006341934,0.0009619443,0.016024929,0.0374754447

"I problemi principali per me sono stati: il confronto impietoso in ricezione con conegliano, che grazie alla coppia de Gennaro Robinson ci potrebbe essere di fianco anche un centrale a ricevere e le percentuali sarebbero comunque altissime; il muro, davvero pochissimi tocchi in generale e i muri punto pochissimi in quattro set; il solito problema della palla in 4 di orro, quasi sempre molto a filo e troppo bassa; la sfortuna di perdere myriam e Paola dopo il secondo set, perchÃ© ok che Paola Ã¨ rientrata ma non era piÃ¹ lei, e questo Ã¨ per forza causa di una preparazione atletica sbagliata.
